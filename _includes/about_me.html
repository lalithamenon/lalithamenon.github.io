            Hailing from India, I am a Masters students in Computer Science from Wichita State University, KS, USA. After completing my undergraduate degree in Computer Science
			 and Engineering, I worked at the software solutions giant Infosys Ltd for over 3 years as Senior Systems Engineer. Trained in Java, Objective C, HTML and CSS, my expertise 
			 is building mobile applications using Swift and Java. During my time in the industry, I had the opportunity to work with many notable clients giving me 
			 valuable insight and leadership oppotunities. Currently I work part time in the University teaching Introduction to programming and Object Oriented programming labs using C++.

           Being a hard worker and a team player, I'm looking for an opportunity where I can learn something new and grow everyday.
           I hope for challenging yet supportive work environment where there is no limit to iamgination and possibilities.
           I'm looking for a front end developer role where I can take on collaborative
           team leadership responsibilites, and gain experience with
           project management.
